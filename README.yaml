# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Terraform module to lookup network resources within a [Kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops) cluster

# How to use this project
usage: |-
  ```hcl
  module "kops_metadata" {
    source       = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-kops-data-network.git?ref=master"
    cluster_name = "cluster.domain.com"
  }
  ```
  The module will use the cluster name to look up resources via AWS tags. If that fails or picks the wrong network,
  you can pass in the correct AWS VPC ID in `vcp_id` and it will return the information related to that VPC.
